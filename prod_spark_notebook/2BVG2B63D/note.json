        "msg": "1 38602261645:Where were our Attorneys General at the time Alberto R. Gonzales up until Sept 2007 and then replaced by Attorney General Michael Mukasey November 9, 2007 – January 20, 2009 followed by Eric Holder. Here is a description of the U.S. Attorney General. The United States Attorney General (A.G.) is the head of the United States Department of Justice per 28 U.S.C. \u0026sect; 503, concerned with legal affairs and is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States government. Here is an old commentary about Eric Holder.  Huffington Post Politics  As Evidence Mounts, DC Insiders Worry About Holder\u0027s Inaction on Wall Street Crime  Posted: 07/10/2012 12:56 am EDT Updated: 09/08/2012 5:12 am EDT   More and more Washington insiders are asking a question that was considered off-limits in the nation\u0027s capital just a few months ago: Who, exactly, is Attorney General Eric Holder representing? As scandal after scandal erupts on Wall Street, involving everything from global lending manipulation to cocaine and prostitution, more and more people are worrying about Holder\u0027s seeming inaction – or worse – in the face of mounting evidence.   Confidential sources say that the President\u0027s much-touted Mortgage Fraud Task Force is being starved for vital resources by the Holder Justice Department. Political insiders are fearful that this obstruction will threaten Democrats\u0027 chances at the polls. Investigators and prosecutors from other agencies are expressing their frustration as the ever-rowing list of documented crimes by individual Wall Street bankers continues to be ignored.  Meanwhile the scandals and revelations go on. The new LIBOR rate-fixing scandal led the bank-friendly and conservative magazine The Economist to run a cover about “Banksters” and to publish a piece entitled “The rotten heart of finance.” People like Robert Reich are saying this could be the story that finally brings down the banks.   Where are the indictments?  But there have already been stories – lots of stories, terrible ones – about corruption, bribery, perjury, forgery and a dozen different kinds of fraud. There have been stories about laundering money for the Mexican drug cartels, including a new lead that surfaced this week. There\u0027s already ample evidence that Wall Street bankers have defrauded cities, deceived investors and cheated their own clients.  Some of the bankers even rewarded themselves in that time-honored tradition of gangsters everywhere: with hookers, blow and orgies.   The problem isn\u0027t a shortage of scandalous stories. We\u0027ve seen a lot of those. What we haven\u0027t seen, at least here in the United States, is a single indictment of a senior Wall Street banker from the United States Department of Justice. And that\u0027s what has these political insiders concerned.   Questions raised  [color\u003dred]A growing number of people are privately expressing concern at the Justice Department\u0027s long-standing pattern of inactivity, obfuscation and obstruction[/color]. Mr. Holder\u0027s past as a highly-paid lawyer for a top Wall Street firm, Covington and Burling, is being discussed more openly among insiders. Covington \u0026amp; Burling was the law firm which devised the MERS shell corporation that has since been implicated in many cases of mortgage and foreclosure fraud.   Nobody we talked to wanted to publicly demean a public official\u0027s reputation. Few of the people who are criticizing Holder privately want to fuel the right-wing witch hunt against him, which recently led to in the Republican House\u0027s shamefully politicized contempt citation. But more of them expressed concerns about Holder, and expressed them strongly, than we expected.  The attorney general is the nation\u0027s chief law enforcement officer. But when it comes to Wall Street, they note that there\u0027s not a lot of federal law enforcement going on.   Obstructing the task force?  The Mortgage Fraud Task Force stands at the heart of the latest controversy. In January\u0027s State of the Union address, the President said that “This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.”   And yet there have been no concrete results since that announcement. One source familiar with the task force said that other federal agencies were actively participating in the process, but that the Justice Department was preventing the group from getting even the relatively meager resources promised to it by the Justice Department.   While nobody provided precise numbers, several sources said the Task Force could show concrete results with twenty or thirty more staff members. Yet Holder\u0027s Justice Department won\u0027t make them available, said one source. By contrast, Republican officials allocated more than one thousand people to investigate the savings and loan scandal.  “The other agencies have been working pretty hard on this effort,” said a source. “But it\u0027s Justice\u0027s show, and they\u0027re not moving.”  Political worries mount   The mood on Capitol Hill is even darker. One of the kinder words used by staffers there is “frustration” – or extreme frustration\u0026quot; – to describe their feelings the Task Force\u0027s lack of resources and results. Several of the people we spoke with expressed concern that senior Administration officials like Holder may be protecting their relationships on Wall Street because they hope to resume their careers there after leaving public service.   One Democratic political strategist expressed concerns that the Task Force\u0027s inactivity could cause irreparable damage to the President\u0027s reelection campaign, by undercutting his “Bain Capital” strategy. That strategy has been working for Mr. Obama, and Democrats on the Hill hope that it will help them too.   But if there are no concrete results from the Obama Justice Department before November, they fear that the entire strategy could be undercut. As his own contributors come under closer scrutiny, they\u0027re afraid that the President himself could be seen as “just another Wall Street politician,” dealing a potentially fatal blow to his candidacy and that of Democrats further down the ticket.   No shortage of suspects  It\u0027s not as if there\u0027s a shortage of suspects for the Justice Department to pursue. We examined the role of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers in the AIG scandal. Now it\u0027s been implicated in the LIBOR scandal. As American Banker points out, PwC had at least two opportunities to catch the LIBOR deceptions. We would add that auditors have a legal obligation, at least in this country, to report any irregularities before signing off on the bank\u0027s financials.  And while a British official wants false reporting of lending rates (the heart of the LIBOR story) to be made illegal, fraud and misrepresentation already are illegal. Then there are the numerous violations of law admitted to by JPMorgan Chase. In the case of GE Capital, investigators were stunned by the lack of prosecutions after the SEC identified individuals inside that bank who prepared fraudulent documents.  The Justice Department has continued to say that it\u0027s difficult to win convictions in bank fraud cases, but an old-fashioned, Mob-style prosecution recently proved them wrong. Worse, there\u0027s no evidence that this Justice Department has even tried.  No Sweat  What\u0027s more, until now federal investigators have appeared to ignored evidence of drug use and prostitution among Wall Streeters – evidence which experts argue could be used to obtain convictions. “High-End Prostitute Bust has Some Folks on Wall Street Sweating,” CNBC wrote last year. They needn\u0027t have worried. As prosecutors and attorneys have pointed out, it\u0027s been common practice to push criminal investigations by pressuring lower-level informants over charges like these. (Attorney Abigail Field elaborates.)   And yet these avenues of investigation have gone unused, despite the many opportunities they provided for applying pressure – and not just over prostitution charges. As Reuters reported, the organization in question was a “high-end prostitution ring catering to Wall Street clients who often would spend over $10,000 for a night bingeing on sex and cocaine.” (“High-end” refers to the income level of the clientele, in case you were wondering.)  Other opportunities have been wasted as well. Whistleblowers have been ignored, rather than sent before a grand jury in order to obtain indictments. Other crimes have been passed over, rather than used to break larger cases.   Mounting evidence  Meanwhile in the absence of punishment the bankers\u0027s behavior is getting more and more extreme, like pyromaniac children begging to be caught. Some examples:  Wells Fargo has already been implicated in the laundering of money for the Mexican drug cartels that have murdered as many as sixty thousand people, as well as having been found to have engaged in some of the most egregious borrower fraud. Now, as attorney Field notes, it\u0027s even illegally closing the bank accounts of unfriendly bloggers to extract revenge.  Despite its massive rap sheet, which includes investor fraud and the bribing of Alabama officials, and despite the SEC investigation of its “London whale” debacle, JPMorgan Chase is is defying a subpoena in California and refusing to turn its emails over to a judge. It\u0027s charged with the same kind of criminal activity that was behind the Enron scandal: manipulating energy markets.   And despite Jamie Dimon\u0027s suggestion that the head of the “London whale\u0027s” group would be forced to return her ill-gotten millions, she was allowed to resign and keep the money. There\u0027s no sign that a criminal investigation of this affair is underway, despite Dimon\u0027s own admission that laws may have been broken.  Field also points out that Barclays has been caught red-handed at similar kinds of fraud before, but they didn\u0027t stop. Without indictments, why would they? Those settlements are just the cost of doing business – a cost someone else pays, while the criminals themselves get rich  The SEC and state law enforcement officials have been moving, issuing “Wells notices” (an SEC document sent to banks under investigation) and searching for information. That much is a matter of public record.  Where\u0027s Mr. Holder?  But there\u0027s no evidence that Mr. Holder\u0027s Justice Department has mounted a serious effort to investigate bank crime. Its first, much-touted “coordinated effort” to crack down on mortgage fraud turned out to be a PR trick, not a law enforcement effort, which the Columbia Journalism Review described with the headline, “The Obama Administration\u0027s Financial-Fraud Stunt Backfires.” That\u0027s not the kind of press a President wants to see repeated in an election year.   “Democrats have been having good luck painting Romney as the candidate of the one percent,” said one observer. “But that could change quickly with a few bad headlines.”   While nobody we spoke with was willing to raise the subject of a Holder resignation, they did insist that time was running out for the Attorney General to show concrete results.  Without criminal investigations and indictments, bankers will continue to commit crimes. The LIBOR scandal, which implicates a number of leading banks, proves that. The Justice Department\u0027s inaction is putting the world economy at risk by allowing bankers to continue their reckless and illegal behavior.  Insiders say that its inaction is putting Barack Obama\u0027s re-election at risk, too, along with that of other Democrats. If the fate of the world doesn\u0027t spur the Administration and its Justice Department into action, perhaps the fate of its President will.\n2

mean? First and foremost, Ebola is not suddenly an airborne disease. As expert commentators at ProMED stated, the experiments \\u0093demonstrate the susceptibility of pigs to Zaire Ebolavirus and that the virus from infected pigs can be transmitted to macaques under experimental conditions\\u0085 they fall short of establishing that this is a normal route of transmission in the natural environment.\\u0094 Furthermore, because human Ebola outbreaks have historically been locally contained, it is unlikely that Ebola can spread between humans via airborne transmission. - See more at:  \u003ca

I know it depends a lot on what you are interested in, but it\u0027s not difficult to find both advising companies on their financial issues vs. advising companies on other issues interesting at the mere age of 21 when you have no idea about the business world and experience in either.   Think of the MM IB as one with not as prestigious of a name, but great deal flow and learning experience. Located OUTSIDE of New York.   Consulting–Think IBM,   Accenture  ,   PwC  –strong brand names with the potential to do strategy work, but lots of potential for systems/technology work.   What might be better after graduation for 2-3 years in terms of keeping options open for the future? Pay, exit opps, top MBA chances, etc.   And on a similar note, can IB at a MM be a feeder into top MBA, or is the brand of your firm regardless of what you do much more important? \n5

  32481096279: I keep hearing it said that   GMAT   is the most important element of the bschool application. But when you plot acceptance v. GMAT, you find that top 10 schools always reject the majority of applicants with any   gmat score  . A school might reject 85% of their 710s, which is understandable, but they also reject 65% of their 760s, which is more surprising. If schools are rejecting the majority of their top GMATs in favor of lower scorers, then something else is deciding the fate of our applications.   With the average applicant putting in months of effort, almost all will apply with airtight narratives, outstanding essays, and polished interview responses, I really don\u0027t believe those 760s are getting dinged because they all wrote stupid stores (e.g. “I\u0027ve only ever worked in general   management consulting   but think I\u0027m a good fit for   Clean Energy  ”).    The only element that could set these applicants apart then is work experience. And with so many applicants in every field, it has to be how elite their work experience is:   MBB   v.   Deloitte  /  Accenture  ; TFA/TFI v. anything else in education. No adcom would ever hint that an elite resume was more important than your GMAT, essays,   GPA  , recommendations and interviews combined, but I can\u0027t find any other explanation. Why do all the people with outstanding numbers get rejected? \n6

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       31386805538: Raytheon ordered two Mark 5 engines, but Cyclone couldn\u0027t deliver working Mark 5s.  Raytheon had to settle for two “Manta 36” engines, which are the crankcases and cylinders of the Mark 5.  Interestingly, while the Mark 5 is advertised as a 100 hp engine, the Mantas, using the same cylinders and crankcase, are only 36 hp engines.    Kevin Bowen wanted to develop a long endurance submersible using Moden fuel.  He needed expertise in steam engine design.  So he sent his engineers to work in Cyclone\u0027s facility to test and measure Cyclone\u0027s engines and gather all the knowledge it took Cyclone several years and many millions of dollars to acquire.  If Bowen just wanted to buy a couple engines, why would he have spent huge money to send engineers to work in Florida?  No, the goal was to get Cyclone\u0027s knowledge.  And now that Raytheon has that knowledge, how much interaction have they had with Cyclone in the last three years?    If you go to the Raytheon web site and search for “Kevin Bowen”, it comes up with two hits from the Raytheon Technlogy Today magazine.  The 2011 Issue #1 has an article written by Bowen on pages 21-22.  Notice all the great things said about the “Schoell cycle”.  This went to Raytheon upper management, and all of Raytheon\u0027s defense customers.  Mr. Bowen really associated himself with Cyclone.  How do you suppose that made him look to his bosses when Cyclone couldn\u0027t deliver a Mark 5 running the “Schoell cycle”?    OSU-CAR is a fee-for-service enterprise.  Regardless of what Harry might say about “partnering” agreements, the deal is Cyclone pays and OSU does engineering work.  The full separation agreement filed with the SEC gives some details about money paid, and it\u0027s not a trivial amount.  The bearing test machine was ordered by Cyclone, and the responsibility for paying for it was transferred to WHE GEN.  Ohio State believes in Cyclone technology as long as the checks don\u0027t bounce.  If OSU was putting their own cash in, there would be PRs telling us."
